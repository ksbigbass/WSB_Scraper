## Reddit Scraper

Because sometimes you need more than just doom-scrolling - you need *organized* doom-scrolling data.

A Python tool for extracting Reddit posts and comments from subreddits. Great for sentiment analysis, trend tracking, or just hoarding internet data like a digital packrat.

**What it does:**
- Pulls posts from any subreddit you point it at
- Saves titles, scores, comments, timestamps
- Exports to CSV for your spreadsheet obsession
- Respects API limits (we're not animals)

**Tech:** Python, PRAW, Pandas
